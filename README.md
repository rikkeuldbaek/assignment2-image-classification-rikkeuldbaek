# **2.2 Description**
For this assignment I have classified the ```Cifar10``` dataset using both a logistic regression classifier and a neural network classifier. I have produced code that does the following: Load the Cifar10 dataset, preprocess the data (i.e., greyscale and reshape), train a logistic regression classifier and a neural network classifier on the data, and save classification reports and models. 

I have written three scripts in order to complete this assignment. The first script preprocesses the data (```data.py```), the second script trains a logistic regression classifier (```logreg_model.py```), and the third script trains a neural network classifier (```neunet_model.py```). In the two model scripts I have used the machine learning tools available via ```scikit-learn```.


<br>


# **2.3 Data**
The ```Cifar10``` dataset consists of 60000 colour images within 10 different classes. Each class has 6000 images with a size of 32x32. The dataset has 50000 training images and 10000 test images, all randomly selected, and this data is loaded in pre-splitted as X_test, y_test, X_train, y_train. The 10 classes (labels) in the dataset are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truc, for more information please see resources. The dataset has been preprocessed within the ```data.py``` script. The preprocessing steps consists of greyscaling, scaling, and reshaping. 

<br>

# **2.4 Repository Structure**
The scripts require a certain folder structure, thus the table below presents the required folders and their description and content.

|Folder name|Description|Content|
|---|---|---|
|```src```|model and data scripts|```data.py```, ```logreg_model.py```, ```neunet_model.py```|
|```out```|classification reports|```LR_metrics_report.txt```, ```NN_metrics_report.txt```|
|```models```|models|```LR_classifier.joblib```, ```NN_classifier.joblib```|


The ```data.py``` script located in ```src``` produces training and test data. The ```logreg_model.py``` and the ```neunet_model.py``` located in ```src``` produce models which are saved in the folder ```models``` and classification reports which are saved in the folder ```out```. 

<br>

# **2.5 Usage and Reproducibility**
## **2.5.1 Prerequisites** 
In order for the user to be able to run the code, please make sure to have bash and python 3 installed on the used device. The code has been written and tested with Python 3.9.2 on a Linux operating system. In order to run the provided code for this assignment, please follow the instructions below.

<br>

## **2.5.2 Setup Instructions** 
**1) Clone the repository**
```python
git clone https://github.com/rikkeuldbaek/assignment2-image-classification-rikkeuldbaek
 ```

**2) Setup** <br>
Setup virtual environment (```VA2_env```) and install packages.
```python
bash setup.sh
```
<br>

## **2.5.3 Running the scripts** 
The command below will automatically run the ```data.py```, ```logreg_model.py```, and ```neunet_model.py``` scripts. The command must be executed in the terminal.  
```python
bash run.sh
```

<br>


### **2.5.4) Script arguments**
The two classifiers have the following default arguments stated below. These arguments can be modified and adjusted in the ```run.sh``` script. If no modifications are added, default parameters are run. In case help is needed, please write ```--help``` in continuation of the code below instead of writing an argument. 

```python
# run the code
python3 src/logreg_model.py # add arguments here
python3 src/neunet_model.py # add arguments here
```

<br>

The ```logreg_model.py``` takes the following arguments:
|Argument|Type|Default|
|---|---|---|
|--penalty |string |"none" |
|--tol |float |0.1 |
|--verbose |boolean |False |
|--solver |string |"saga" |
|--multi_class|string |"multinomial" |

<br>

The ```neunet_model.py``` takes the following arguments:
|Argument|Type|Default|
|---|---|---|
|--random_state |integer |666 |
|--hidden_layer_sizes |integer|(64,20) |
|--learning_rate |string |"adaptive" |
|--early_stopping |boolean |True |
|--verbose |boolean |True |
|--max_iter |integer |20 |

<br>

**Important to note** <br>
The hidden_layer_sizes argument must be specified _without_ commas in the ```run.sh``` script, an example of such:

```python
src/neunet_model.py --hidden_layer_sizes 20 20
 ```


<br>


# **2.6 Results**

From the classification reports located in the ```out``` folder, it is evident that the neural network classifier performs slightly better than the logistic regression classifier with a weighted average F1 score of 39% compared to a weighted average F1 score of 30%. When inspecting the F1 score for each individual class, both the neural network classifier and the logistic regression classifier seems to be best at classifying ships, trucks, and automobiles.
